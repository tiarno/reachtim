Summary: what the blog is about

This blog is about security, LaTeX, Python, and XML.

My day job is at SAS Institute Inc., where I built and run a publishing system for analytics products. 

I love to share what I discover in my daily work and that's what this blog is about; a place to share code and ideas related to security, LaTeX, Python, and XML.

I owe much to open-source communities. I hope you find the information here helpful in your own work.
